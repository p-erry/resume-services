# Folder Structure

Proposed structure for the `resume-services` repository. This document tracks how the project is organized and how it may evolve as a commercial or semi-commercial service.

```text
resume-services/
  README.md
  .gitignore
  LICENSE
  CONTRIBUTING.md

  docs/
    folder-structure.md
    service-tiers.md
    workflow-overview.md

  templates/
    resumes/
    linkedin/

  worksheets/
    narrative_intake.md
    career_history_grid.md
    role_targeting_questionnaire.md

  samples/
    before_after/

  automation/
    scripts/
```

## Rationale

This structure supports the core goals of Resume Services:

* Centralize templates and worksheets for reuse
* Separate documentation from assets and delivery artifacts
* Create space for automation and fulfillment tooling over time
* Enable commercializing the service without having to rebuild the repo structure
